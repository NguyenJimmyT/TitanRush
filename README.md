## How to build

### Requirements

* NodeJS version 20 or higher.
* Android Studio

### Steps

``git clone`` from the branch "Edward"

* Open a terminal/ bash shell/ powershell/ command prompt/ whatever your preference, and run:
``npm install`` to download the dependencies from node.
* Run ``npx expo install`` to install all react-native-expo files.
* Run ``npx expo start`` to start the dev server.

Once the dev server starts, it will begin automatically compiling a development build of TitanRush, and open it on your Android Studio simulator.
